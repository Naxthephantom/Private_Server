# Web_Server
This project is a web server that gives access to a site, in this case the html code which is 
also in the repository, and i've included a qr code which can be scanned to gain access to the 
site server as well.

This project is usesul when trying to build a website of your own with your own server, or if 
you may want a storage space that is not public to the web nor on your system, you can keep it
in the site the server gives access to, but in this case the server will be on a local host just 
the one in the code i've writen is.

How To Run This Code:
To run the server in this repostitory, run the code on your power shell terminal, when 
it shows that server is live, copy the link to the html for the site to any browser on your pc and 
run it, it should show you a simple web site.
