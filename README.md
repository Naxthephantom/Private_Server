# Web_Server
This project is a web server that gives access to a site, in this case the html code which is 
also in the repository, and i've included a qr code which can be scanned to gain access to the 
site server as well.

This project is usesul when trying to build a website of your own with your own server, or if 
you may want a storage space that is not public to the web nor on your system, you can keep it
in the site the server gives access to, but in this case the server will be on a local host just 
the one in the code i've writen is.

How To Run This Code:
To run the server in this repostitory, copy the files in this repository to a directory on your pc 
(preferably desktop) and put them all ini one folder, open Windows power shell on your pc, navigate
to your desktop directory by inputing (cd desktop) then click enter, once you've done that, navigate 
to the folder you've created which contains the code files by inputing (cd *name of the folder*) then
click enter. Next, we'll want to run the code for the server. To this we'll input (python server.py)
if the cursor moves to the next line and doesnt return any error codes, Then the server is live, copy 
the link to the simple website the server grants access to(https://localhost:8080/service.html) and 
search it on any browser on your system.

If you have visual studio code, it would be much easier, all you would have to do is, open the server.py 
code on your VS code and run the code, to do this, you"ll click on the down arrow (beside the triangle) 
on the top right, then sellect the opion to 'run python file', when you do this a terminal will appear 
below the code environment, there you'll see the directoryre you've saved the code written out.
Now you can copy the link for the site (https://localhost:8080/service.html) to your browser and run it.

note: this server is locally hosted i.e it can only be accessed on the system which the code was run. :)
