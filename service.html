                A server is basically a platform that grants the user, known as the 'client', access to a site or a set of data. It is
                basically the bridge between two platforms, it could be used to gain acces to the information on another PC or to a site
                on the internet.

                A web server is a computer software that accepts requests via HTTP i.e, It is a computer program that distributes web 
                pages as they are requested. The basic objective of the web server is to store, process, and deliver web pages to the 
                users, whom we may also call 'clients'. This intercommunication is done using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
